## My admin Dashboard


So a little about the application,
This application uses advanced technologies to help businesses manage their information more effectively. On the front-end, i've used tools like Nivo for data visualization, redux/toolkit query for fast API calls, and MUI for a sleek user interface. i've also used react-datepicker to manage dates and times.

On the back-end, i've used technologies like dotenv for managing environment variables, Helmet for security, morgan for logging, and mongoose for interacting with the database. The most interesting feature of This application is server-side pagination, which helps businesses manage large amounts of data more efficiently.

Overall, This application is designed to be fast, secure, and user-friendly, with advanced features like data visualization and server-side pagination to help businesses manage their information in a more effective way.
